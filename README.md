ü§ñ Chatbot using Python :
A chatbot in Python is an AI-driven program that simulates human conversation. Using libraries like ChatterBot, NLTK, or transformers, you can build bots that respond to user queries, learn from interactions, and automate tasks like customer support or FAQs. Python‚Äôs simplicity and rich NLP ecosystem make it ideal for building both rule-based and AI-powered conversational agents.

2.Project ID - #CC3588

Project Title - Image Recognition

Internship Domain - Artificial Intelligence Intern

Project Level - Intermediate Level

üñºÔ∏è Image Classification using Python :
Image classification is a computer vision task where Python models‚Äîoften built with TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch‚Äîidentify objects in images and assign them to predefined categories. It involves training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on labeled datasets like CIFAR-10 or custom image folders. Python‚Äôs deep learning libraries streamline preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for high-accuracy classification.

Project Title - Natural Language Processing for Legal Documents

Internship Domain - Artificial Intelligence Intern

Project Level - Golden Level

üß† NLP (Natural Language Processing) using Python :
NLP in Python enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and TextBlob support tasks such as tokenization, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and text classification. Python‚Äôs versatility makes it the go-to language for building intelligent systems that process and analyze text data from social media, documents, or chat logs.
